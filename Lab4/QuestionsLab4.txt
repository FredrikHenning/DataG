Lab 4 - Questions

Q1: Changing the focal distance variable will basicaly change the
	frame of view (fov). When increasing the varible everything 
	will seem closer to the camera and decreasing everything will
	seem farther away and more apart.
	(One can also be more specific, if it works like an 
	actual camera then the longer distance between the 
	focal point and the sensor the smaller the angle of
	view will be. If the frame your looking at is the same
	size the objects will seem closer)

Q2:	One of the solution you brought up in the lectures is to 
	cast a bunch of rays/pixel and then compute the average
	instead of one ray.

Q3:	When MAX_DEPTH is at 1 the reflective material does not
	reflect anything and the refracting one is not "see through"
	(does not refract). Both balls have their normal colour.

	When its at 2 both objects do what they intended to do in 
	the eyes of the camera. The reflective material does 
	not pick up that the refracting is is a refracted object. 
	Meaning its not "see through" in the eyes of the 
	reflective material. And the small reflective property
	the refracting material has does not pick up the red ball

	When its at 3 the refractive material is seen as such
	in the eyes of the reflective. 
	The red ball is picked up in the reflection of the refracting
	object but not from the reflecting object->refracting->red ball

	At 5 if we are really picky the seen does not change what
	I can see.
